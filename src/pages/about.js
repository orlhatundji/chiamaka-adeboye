            experiences that lie at the intersection of great visual design,

              the of the mobile products within my Company. I have worked in
              early-stage startups and established organizations on a wide

              products to working on features to help products scale. While the
              majority of my experience has been working in Fintech, Iâ€™ve also
              done some fun projects in child management, E-commerce, Edutech,
